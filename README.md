# euhadra
(planning stub) bear metal virtual machine executer.

# Description
Execute NAND described simple_pmpu virtualmachine on some specific bearmetal computer.
We need one binaried virtual base program.

# Later
We need to implement simple_pmpu and NAND first, so this has no chance at least in a year.

# Recursive on system
We should implement recursive on this with very slow but at least guarantee integrity in some range.

# This is concept and only a compileable document.
We must search preceding patents first before to compile or use.
